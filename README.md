#### Description:
CS50 2023 final project.
The Phonebook Programmed with Python Version 3.10 with SQLite3 Database and Tkinter GUI is a comprehensive system that aims to efficiently utilize open-source components. It is divided into three modules and incorporates a database, making it an ideal project for learning the basics of Python and familiarizing oneself with basic database topics.
Python 3.10 was chosen as the programming language for this project to ensure smooth future development without encountering any fundamental issues. Additionally, the minimal reliance on external packages allows the program to run efficiently on various systems with minimal resource requirements.
In order to enhance the user experience and provide an efficient programming environment, it is recommended to incorporate the Pyqt library for the graphical user interface. By doing so, the program will have a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, along with an enhanced programming space.
When considering the database for this project, SQLite was chosen as the database management system. However, it is important to note that SQLite is a single-user database and has limitations in handling multiple concurrent connections. To overcome this limitation and accommodate larger dimensions and multiple users, it is advisable to explore the use of databases such as MySQL or SQL Server. By utilizing these databases, the program can effectively handle a larger user base and prevent potential issues that may arise from the constraints of SQLite.
The program's functionality is divided into two key modules. The positioning module ensures that forms are placed in the center of the screen and adapt to different screen sizes. This guarantees a consistent and visually appealing user interface across various devices. The db_connection module establishes a connection between the program and the database, handling tasks such as registration, updating, deletion, and search functionalities. By utilizing this module, the program can effectively interact with the database and provide seamless data management capabilities.
For future development, it is recommended to focus on improving the graphical user interface and addressing the limitations of the database. By incorporating the recommended enhancements, the program will provide a more user-friendly experience and be able to handle larger dimensions and multiple users effectively. User feedback is greatly appreciated, as it helps shape the direction of the program's development. The recommendations provided will be considered to enhance the overall functionality and user experience of the project.
The Phonebook program has been tested with PyCharm Community Version 2023 and Spyder IDE, ensuring compatibility with popular Python development environments. It follows open-source rules and is available for free on GitHub.
